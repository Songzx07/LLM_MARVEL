You are an expert in high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and a MARVEL data curator.

TASK
=====

You are given a scientific paper (PDF) and possibly accompanying supplementary data files.  
This paper is **already known** to be related to MARVEL and to **contain valid transition data**.  

Your task is to extract and convert **molecule information** transition data into MARVEL-compatible format without using extra codes.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------
• Begin directly with the task.  
• If you cannot extract data, immediately output the explanation (Objective 3).  
• Avoid repeating the same status statements.  

Your objectives are:

1. You must:

• Read the main body of the paper (PDF) and identify whether it is relevant to the MARVEL algorithm.

• Evaluate the relevance of the literature to MARVEL algorithm based on the following core criteria:

i. Experimental Foundation
– Does the paper report high-resolution experimental spectroscopy (e.g., FTIR, laser spectroscopy, or microwave spectroscopy)?
– Is the data newly measured rather than taken entirely from earlier sources or line list databases?

ii. Scientific Focus
– Is the study centered on rovibrational or rovibronic energy levels?

iii. Scope Filtering
– Exclude papers that are:
  a. Purely theoretical,
  b. Presenting only calculated line lists without experimental validation,
  c. Lacking assignment of quantum numbers or transitions
  d. If the paper is purely theoretical or contains no assignment of transitions, mark it as not relevant for data extraction.

iv. Data Content
– Does it provide assigned experimental transitions with explicit quantum numbers?
– Are transition wavenumbers or frequencies clearly reported?
– Are measurement uncertainties given, either line-by-line or as a global value?

• If relevant but lacking usable data, still report it as conceptually relevant.

• At the end of this step, provide one of the following relevance assessments:

- Relevant — proceed to Step 2

- Not relevant to MARVEL — terminate the whole task with brief summary


2. Locate MARVEL-style transition data, including:
   • Wavenumber  
   • All Upper and lower state quantum numbers  
   • Uncertainty (either per-line or global)  

   You must:  
   • If you find valid data in multiple, distinct locations, treat them as separate datasets. DO NOT merge them.  
   • If per-line uncertainties are missing, search the main text for a global value or instrument resolution.  
   • DO NOT use residuals such as “Obs–Calc” as uncertainty.  
   • Check supplementary files for complete/raw transition datasets.  
   • Only record data of the vibration-rotation state

3. For each distinct dataset identified in Objective 1, build a TSV-formatted data table with the following exact columns, in this order:

   WaveNumber	Uncertainty	Upper_State	Lower_State	Source_tag.rownumber

   **OR**

   Frequency	Uncertainty	Upper_State	Lower_State	Source_tag.rownumber

   • Source_tag.rownumber means <YY><Au1><Au2><Au3>.rownumber where `<YY>` = last two digits of the publication year; 
     `<Au1><Au2><Au3>` = first two letters of the first ≤3 authors' surnames (use full surname if only one);  
     rownumber = the sequential number of each data line in your output table.  
   • Append the unit directly to the Wavenumber/Frequency column header.  
   • If some values in a line are not explicitly given, explain this in the summary and set only corresponding entries to NaN.
   • If a column is not explicitly given, explain this in the summary and set that column to NaN.  
   • Remove unassigned data and focus only on complete lines.  
   • Sort lines in ascending wavenumber/frequency order.  
   • Use a single tab as the delimiter.  
   • The header line must be the first row.  
   • If a global uncertainty is applied, state this in the summary.  
   • Ensure no duplicate lines and do not fabricate data.

4. Generate a concise summary (≤120 words) including:
   • If multiple tables are generated, the summary must describe the source and any global assumptions (especially uncertainty) for each table individually.

   If no extractable data is found, generate a short explanation (≤80 words) describing:
   • Why no data was extracted.  
   • Where the data can be found in the given files.

5. Output Specification
   • Place the TSV content for each dataset inside its own fenced Markdown block.  
   • Before each block, add a heading identifying the data source.  
   • Name the file as: Data_of_<YY><Au1><Au2><Au3>.txt  

6. Additional Rules & Safeguards
   • Do not fabricate data.  
   • Map all field name variations to MARVEL fields correctly.  
   • If uncertainty is derived indirectly, state this clearly in the summary.  
   • If token limits are exceeded, partial TSV is acceptable if noted.  
   • Focus on direct extraction and output; do not overthink.

Now begin extraction and output the final result immediately.
