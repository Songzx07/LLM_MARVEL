An interband cascade laser with the emission wavelength of 3.29 μm was used to target noninterference CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> lines at 3038.5 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. To diminish the background noise of the sensor system, wavelength modulation spectroscopy combined with a second harmonic measurement technique was used in this work. Finally, 1.83 parts per billion in volume (ppbv) minimum measurement limit (MML) was obtained with a 4 s integration time based on an Allan‐Werle variance analysis, and the MML can be further improvedto ∼0.4 ppbv by increasing the integration time up to 104 s. Indoor and outdoor environmental data of CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> acquired using the TDLAS sensor system are also reported.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An automated system was developed using commercially available Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) technology (Picarro LTD., G2508) which was interfaced to a custom-made system which automated the equilibration and analysis of seawater dissolved nitrous oxide (N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O) and methane (CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>). The combined system was deployed during two research cruises in the Atlantic Ocean, which combined covered 16,500 kms, one on a west to east transect between the United States and Europe at approximately 24°N, the second was a north to south transect which covered approximately 70° of latitude between the Tropic of Cancer and the Southern Ocean. Semi-continuous measurements using the CRDS (Approx. 73,000) were compared to discretely collected samples (n=156) which were analysed using gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionisation detection for CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and electron capture detection for N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O. Excellent agreement between the two approaches, though with an increase in analytical precision offered by CRDS compared to GC gives great confidence in the applicability of the CRDS system, whilst the significant (2 to 3 orders of magnitude) increase in measurement frequency offer an opportunity to greatly increase the number of dissolved N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> data that are currently available. Whilst identifying a number of small-scale features, deployment during this study showed that whilst the surface of large areas of the Atlantic Ocean were in-balance with the overlying atmosphere with respect to N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O, the most of this region was offering a source of atmospheric CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are among the most important atmospheric greenhouse gases. A gas sensor based on a tunable 7.6 μm continuous-wave external-cavity mode-hop-free (EC-MHF) quantum cascade laser (from 1290 to 1350 cm−1) cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) technique was developed for the simultaneous detection of CH4 and N2O in ambient air with water vapor (H2O) mostly removed via molecular sieve drying to minimize the impact of H2O on the simultaneous measurements. Still, due to the broad and strong absorption spectrum of H2O in the entire mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral range, residual H2O in the dried ambient air due to incomplete drying and leakage, if not properly accounted for, could cause a significant influence on the measurement accuracy of the simultaneous CH4 and N2O detection. In this paper, the impact of residual H2O on the simultaneous CH4 and N2O measurements were analyzed by comparing the CH4 and N2O concentrations determined from the measured spectrum in the spectral range from 1311 to 1312.1 cm−1 via simultaneous CH4 and N2O measurements and that determined from the measured spectrum in the spectral range from 1311 to 1313 cm−1 via simultaneous CH4, N2O, and H2O measurements. The measured dependence of CH4 and N2O concentration errors on the simultaneously determined H2O concentration indicated that the residual H2O caused an under-estimation of CH4 concentration and over-estimation of N2O concentration. The H2O induced CH4 and N2O concentration errors were approximately linearly proportional to the residual H2O concentration. For the measurement of air flowing at 3 L per min, the residual H2O concentration was stabilized to approximately 14 ppmv, and the corresponding H2O induced errors were −1.3 ppbv for CH4 and 3.7 ppbv for N2O, respectively.</jats:p>",
