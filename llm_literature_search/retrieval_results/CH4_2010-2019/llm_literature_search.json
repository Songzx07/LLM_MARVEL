      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. A high-sensitivity methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide\n(N2O) sensor based on mid-infrared continuous-wave (CW) cavity\nring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) techniques was developed for environmental and\nbiomedical trace-gas measurements. A tunable external-cavity mode-hop-free\n(EC-MHF) quantum cascade laser (QCL) operating at 7.4 to 7.8 µm was\nused as the light source. The effect of temperature fluctuation on the\nmeasurement sensitivity of the CRDS experimental setup was analyzed and\ncorrected, and a sensitivity limit of absorption coefficient measurement of\n7.2×10-10 cm−1 was achieved at 1330.50 cm−1 with\nan average of 139 measurements or 21 s averaging time and further\nimproved to 2.3×10-10 cm−1 with an average of 3460\nmeasurements, or 519 s averaging time. For the targeted CH4 and\nN2O, absorption lines located at 1298.60 and 1327.07 cm−1 with\ntemperature effect correction detection limits of 13 and 11 pptv were experimentally achieved with 10.4 and 10.2 s\naveraging times and could be further improved to 5 and 9 pptv with\n482.5 and 311 s averaging times, respectively. Four spectral\nbands (1298.4 to 1298.9 cm−1, 1310.1 to\n1312.3 cm−1, 1326.5 to 1328 cm−1, and 1331.5 to\n1333 cm−1) in the spectral range from 1295 to 1335 cm−1\nwere selected for the separate and simultaneous measurements of CH4 and\nN2O under normal atmospheric pressure, and all were in good agreements.\nThe concentrations of CH4 and N2O of atmospheric air collected at\ndifferent locations and of exhaled breath were measured and analyzed.\nContinuous measurements of CH4 and N2O concentrations of indoor\nlaboratory air over 45 h were also taken. It was found that anaerobic\nbacteria in the water and soil of wetlands might significantly increase the\nCH4 concentration in the air. The measured N2O concentration in the\ncentral city area was somewhat lower than the reported normal level in open\nair. Our results demonstrated the temporal and spatial variations of\nCH4 and N2O in the air.\n                    </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Methane is an important raw material for various petrochemicals in industrial fields and as also a clean fuel in daily life. However, as an inflammable and explosive material, methane leak can lead to disastrous consequences such as fire and explosion. Furthermore, as a kind of greenhouse gas, methane has stronger influence on global warming than carbon dioxide. In this paper, we present a new high sensitive scheme for methane remote sensing, which can facilitate detection and location of methane leakage. And the 2v3 band (near 1653.7 nm) of methane is chosen as the target transition which is free from the absorption of the other molecule in atmosphere. A tunable distributed-feedback diode laser is adapted to scan across the target transition. A Fresnel lens with a diameter of 150 mm is employed to collect the ambient backscattering light from natural features such as the buildings. The first harmonic signal is used to normalize the second harmonic signal to remove the influence introduced by the unknown reflectance factor of the actual target, therefore no retro-reflector is needed. Traditional tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) method has difficulty in locating the second harmonic signal peak position in low concentration conditions because of low signal-noise-ratio (SNR). To improve the SNR especially in low concentration environment, a scheme named baseline-offset TDLAS is presented in the paper, in which a reference cell filled with standard methane sample is inserted into the measuring optical path. The reference cell can also be used to calibrate the sensor. Furthermore, the reference cell can be used to lock the central frequency of the diode laser to the absorption peak position to monitor concentration fluctuation continuously. In the peak-locking mode, the sensor demodulates the third harmonic signal as error signal to control the injection current of the laser source with PID control. Moreover, one advantage of peak-locking mode is that the measurement frequency is about two orders of magnitude higher than the traditional TDLAS method. With baseline-offset TDLAS, the remote sensor described in this paper obtains SNRs as high as 19 and 16 at a stand-off distance of 10 m and 20 m, respectively. With such a high SNR, there is no necessity for complex algorithm in absorption peak position location. By defining the standard deviation of the measuring concentration as the detection limit, experimental results show that the proposed methane remote sensor has detection limits of 5 ppm m at a distance of 10 m and 16 ppmm for 20 m, respectively, while measuring the ambient methane. In peak-locked mode, the experimental system has a detection limit of 22 ppmm at a distance up to 37 m and can monitor rapid concentration fluctuation in.</jats:p>",

The peak position of the <jats:italic>ν</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> band remains practically unchanged, and peak positions of all other bands, by analogy with the <jats:italic>ν</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> band, are shifted toward lower wavenumbers with pressure increase.

The spectra were recorded in gas flows of nitrogen with small admixtures of the hydrocarbons. A fused silica glass tube surrounded by an electric heating wire was used to heat the gas flows. The recorded IR‐DFWM spectra are compared with simulations using the spectral information available in the HITRAN database, in order to identify spectral lines. The measurements demonstrate good signal to noise ratio and good sensitivity even at elevated temperatures. Several weak hot lines were detected that are not included in the current database. This paper demonstrates the potential of IR‐DFWM for purposes of investigating spectral lines at elevated temperatures, which is often a challenging task with conventional absorption spectroscopy techniques. The possibility of applying IR‐DFWM for combustion diagnostics of small hydrocarbons is discussed from the detection limits of the measurements and the potential water line interference. Because of the non‐linear nature of the DFWM technique, it provides much higher contrast for strong lines of small molecules over backgrounds of high‐density weak lines, which commonly exist in hot gas flows of thermochemical reactions.

The frequency axis of spectra was linked to the primary frequency standard. Three different cavity enhanced absorption and dispersion spectroscopic methods and various approaches to data analysis were used to estimate potential systematic instrumental errors. Except for a well established frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy, we applied the cavity mode-width spectroscopy and the one-dimensional cavity mode-dispersion spectroscopy for measurement of absorption and dispersion spectra, respectively. We demonstrated the highest quality of the dispersion line shape measured in optical spectroscopy so far. We obtained line positions of the Doppler-broadened R24 and R28 transitions with relative uncertainties at the level of 10−10. The pressure shifting coefficients were measured and the influence of the line asymmetry on unperturbed line positions was analyzed. Our dispersion spectra are the first demonstration of molecular spectroscopy with both axes of the spectra directly linked to the primary frequency standard, which is particularly desirable for the future reference-grade measurements of molecular spectra.</jats:p>",

This provides the so far most complete data set on methane spectra in this range at high resolution. In the present work we report in particular those results, where the partial rovibrational analysis allows for the direct assignment of pure (J = 0) vibrational levels including high excitation. These results substantially extend the accurate knowledge of vibrational band centers to higher energies and provide a benchmark for both the comparison with theoretical results on the one hand and atmospheric spectroscopy on the other hand. We also present a simple effective Hamiltonian analysis, which is discussed in terms of vibrational level assignments and 13C isotope effects.</jats:p>",
