      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. N2-broadened half widths and pressure shifts were obtained for transitions in the Q and R branches of the 2ν3 methane band. Laboratory measurements were done from 5985 to 6185 cm−1 using spectra recorded at 0.011 cm−1 resolution with a Bruker 120 HR Fourier transform spectrometer. A 140 cm gas cell was filled with methane at room temperature and N2 as foreign gas at pressures ranging from 125 to 900 hPa. A multispectrum nonlinear constrained least squares approach based on Optimal Estimation was applied to derive the spectroscopic parameters by simultaneously fitting laboratory spectra at different ambient pressures assuming a Voigt line-shape. At room temperature, the half widths ranged between 0.030 and 0.071 cm−1 atm−1, and the pressure shifts varied from −0.002 to −0.025 cm−1 atm−1 for transitions up to J\"=10. Especially for higher rotational levels, we find systematically narrower lines than HITRAN predicts. The new set of spectroscopic parameters is further tested with ground based direct sun FTIR measurements where fit residuals reduce by about a factor of 3–4. We report the implication of those differences on atmospheric methane measurements using high-resolution ground based FTIR measurements as well as low-resolution spectra from the SCIAMACHY instrument onboard ENVISAT. We find that for SCIAMACHY, a latitudinal and seasonally varying bias of about 1% can be introduced by erroneous broadening parameters.\n                        </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>High-resolution infrared laser spectroscopy is used to study the CH3⋯HF and CD3⋯HF radical complexes, corresponding to the exit-channel complex in the F+CH4→HF+CH3 reaction. The complexes are formed in helium nanodroplets by sequential pickup of a methyl radical and a HF molecule. The rotationally resolved spectra presented here correspond to the fundamental v=1←0 H–F vibrational band, the analysis of which reveals a complex with C3v symmetry. The vibrational band origin for the CH3⋯HF complex (3797.00cm−1) is significantly redshifted from that of the HF monomer (3959.19cm−1), consistent with the hydrogen-bonded structure predicted by theory [E. Ya. Misochko et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, 11997 (1995)] and suggested by previous matrix isolation experiments [M. E. Jacox, Chem. Phys. 42, 133 (1979)]. The permanent electric dipole moment of this complex is experimentally determined by Stark spectroscopy to be 2.4±0.3D. The wide amplitude zero-point bending motion of this complex is revealed by the vibrational dependence of the A rotational constant. A sixfold reduction in the line broadening associated with the H–F vibrational mode is observed in going from CH3⋯HF to CD3⋯HF. The results suggest that fast relaxation in the former case results from near-resonant intermolecular vibration-vibration (V-V) energy transfer. Ab initio calculations are also reported (at the MP2 level) for the various stationary points on the F+CH4 surface, including geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency calculations for CH3⋯HF.</jats:p>",

These spectra are presented in the region 3120–2980 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. A clear pressure dependence of the area ratio between two weak methane bands, ν<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (asymmetric CH stretching) and 2ν<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (overtone of the asymmetric CH bending), is observed; the methane ν<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> band intensity is lowered relative to the methane 2ν<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as the pressure is raised. The intensity ratios between these two bands, <jats:italic>I</jats:italic>(ν<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>)/<jats:italic>I</jats:italic>(2ν<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), were determined and plotted as a function of pressure. Surprisingly it is observed that the ratio at a fixed pressure is independent of the composition and thereby of the surroundings in which the methane molecule is vibrating. A model function to predict the pressure is given. From a practical point of view, the present results could be useful for determining directly the total pressure in methane mixtures the composition of which is not known.

Individual fuel particles were suspended in the freeboard of the unit. The bed temperature was 800 ?C, the oxygen partial pressure 0 to 20 kPa (0-10 vol.%). Two Fabry Perot type tunable near infrared diode lasers were deployed for quantitative in-situ species concentration measurements. CH4 and CO were measured simultaneously during devolatilization and char combustion in-situ 10 mm above the surface of the fuel particles as well as H2O using laser spectroscopy. Sand particles were passing the probing laser beam path. Besides the resonant absorption of the laser light by CO, CH4 and H2O severe and strongly transient non-resonant attenuation by partial blocking of the beam and beam steering effects occurred. By wavelength tuning the two laser sources, species concentrations could be determined. The measured absorbances had to be corrected for the real temperature measured at the position of the probing laser beam. In addition, CO, CO2 and O2 were determined ex-situ by con ventional methods. A spatial profile inside the FBC of major species (CH4, CO, CO2, O, H, OH) was calculated using a chemical kinetics program for a single fuel particle in a plug flow reactor geometry. The results were compared to the experimental findings. Good agreement was found. Tunable diode laser spectroscopy was found to be an apt method of determining quantitative species concentrations of multiple gases in a high temperature multi phase environment.</jats:p>",
