By varying the methane percentage seeded in the carrier gas, we have studied the evolution of the spectrum vs the rotational temperature. The rotational cooling drastically reduces the congestion of the spectrum and only a few lines are observed in the spectrum corresponding to the lowest rotational temperature. In the 11 245–11 315 cm−1 range, the rotational structure of two superimposed bands is clearly observed. The lowest rotational levels of each band are assigned and the corresponding band origins, rotational constants and Coriolis parameters are obtained. The two bands are assigned to the two components of a Fermi dyad corresponding to the interaction of the 3ν1+ν3 (F2) stretching level carrying the oscillator strength with a near resonant vibrational state of the background. The high mixing of the vibrational wave functions is reflected by the close values of the rotational constants obtained for the two bands. In the lower energy range of the spectrum (11 170–11 245 cm−1), two weaker vibrational bands are tentatively assigned.</jats:p>",

State-to-state rotational energy transfer rates are obtained in the ground and ν3+ν4 excited vibrational levels, and compared with theoretical predictions and with pressure-broadening measurements on the corresponding transitions.

The far-infrared data result in permanent electric dipole moments (‖μz0‖=(5.69±0.14)×10−3 D for CHD3, ‖μz0‖=(5.57±0.10)×10−3 D for CH3D), consistent with previous experimental data. The integrated N=5 overtone cross section is found to be (0.828±0.068) fm2. The overtone data are used, together with previous data, to derive a new, nine-dimensional, isotopically invariant dipole moment function for CH4 within the chromophore model for the CH chromophore in CHD3. With this function, the experimental data can be reproduced to an averaged factor of 1.2, in the best case. In the vibrational ground state, a nine-dimensional calculation of expectation values on a new, fully anharmonic potential surface was performed using the solution of the rovibrational Schrödinger equation by diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods. The results for the rotational constants of several isotopomers, which include significant contributions from rovibrational interactions, indicate that the equilibrium CH bond length of methane is re=108.6 pm. The calculated value for the vibrationally averaged permanent dipole moment from these nine-dimensional vibrational quantum calculations, using the dipole moment function consistent with the analysis of the overtone bands, is μz0=−(6.6±0.4)×10−3 D for CHD3 (with positive z coordinate for the H atom) and μz0=(6.8±0.5)×10−3 D for CH3D (with positive z coordinate for the D atom) in essential agreement with the far-infrared rotational intensities. The sign could be determined unambiguously by comparison with ab initio data. We predict the permanent dipole moment of several further methane isotopomers. The polarity of the CH bond in methane is C−–H+, within our simple bond dipole model, but is discussed to be a model dependent (not purely experimental) quantity.</jats:p>",
