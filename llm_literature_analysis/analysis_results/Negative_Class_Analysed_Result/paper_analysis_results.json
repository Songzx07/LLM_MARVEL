While its primary output is theoretical, it extensively relies on and validates against 'published analyses of experimental laboratory CH4 spectra', 'assigned transitions', and 'empirically determined energy levels from laboratory spectra analyses'. It states that 'The energy levels... have been essentially provided by the MIRS software... used to analyse methane spectra' and 'For the icosad, we have used the recent assigned transitions (~13000) to provide a set of ~7400 energy levels'. This aligns with MARVEL's goal of reconstructing energy levels from assigned experimental transitions. The paper's discussion of data quality, empirical corrections based on experimental data, and comparison with experimental databases (like HITRAN and Grenoble lists) demonstrates a strong conceptual alignment with the high-resolution spectroscopy and energy level analysis that MARVEL addresses."

It involves experimental spectroscopic measurements and analysis of wavenumber shifts and broadening, which are conceptually related to molecular energy levels and transitions. Although its primary objective is not to reconstruct energy levels but rather to understand environmental effects on spectral features for natural gas diagnostics, the study employs experimental techniques and analyses spectral characteristics (wavenumbers, line shapes) that are within the broader domain of high-resolution molecular spectroscopy."

It reports on experimental measurements of Raman shifts and half-widths of vibrational Q-branches under different environmental conditions, and discusses the influence of various gases on these spectral characteristics. However, the paper does not provide MARVEL-compatible experimental data. It lacks the crucial component of full quantum number assignments for both the upper and lower states for any individual rovibrational transitions. The reported data pertains to the shifts and widths of unresolved Q-branches, not discrete, assigned rovibrational lines necessary for the MARVEL algorithm to reconstruct energy levels."

Its primary objective is to demonstrate the performance of a novel compact dense-pattern multipass cell (DP-MPC) for trace gas sensing, focusing on sensitivity, precision, and practical applications. While it utilizes spectroscopic principles and references existing spectroscopic databases (HITRAN) to select a target absorption line, it does not involve the measurement of new rovibrational transitions, the assignment of quantum numbers for these transitions, or the determination/reconstruction of molecular energy levels. Therefore, its content and objectives are not aligned with MARVEL's goal of reconstructing molecular energy level structures from experimental spectroscopic data."
