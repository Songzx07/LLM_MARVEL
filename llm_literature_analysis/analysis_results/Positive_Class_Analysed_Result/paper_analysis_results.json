These data are stated to be in Table 1, come with explicit uncertainty estimates (0.5e-3 cm-1 and 6e-3 cm-1), and are implied to be fully assigned with quantum numbers, making them compatible input for the MARVEL algorithm. Accessing the full Table 1 from the PDF would be necessary to extract the complete dataset."
