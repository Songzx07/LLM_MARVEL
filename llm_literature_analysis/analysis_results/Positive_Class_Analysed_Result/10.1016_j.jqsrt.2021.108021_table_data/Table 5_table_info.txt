FOOTNOTES:
----------------------------------------
  1. Notes:.
  2. [tb5fn1] Isotopologue ID: 61 - ^{12}CH_{4}, 62 - ^{13}CH_{4}, 63 - CH_{3}D and Key: + assigned line, - unassigned line, 3 corresponds to ^{13}CH_{4} or CH_{3}D.
  3. [tb5fn4] Lower and upper state rovibrational assignments are given by the vibrational polyad number P, the rotational quantum number J, the rovibrational symmetry type C (T_{d} irreducible representation) and the rovibration ranking index α.
  4. [tb5fn5] E_{low}: recommended value for the lower state energy [in cm^{−1}]. Order of priority: exact assignment, lower J, observed E lower, default E lower corresponded to J = 12 (see Text).
  5. [tb5fn6] Self-Broadening coefficient obtained from [78].
  6. [tb5fn7] Air-Broadening coefficient obtained from [79].
