Table Caption: Absolute line-center frequencies, ν _{0}, for the 46 strong, isolated ^{12}CH_{4} lines and their absolute frequency uncertainty, σ. Line assignments are from Ref. [8] and (–) denotes unassigned lines. The discrepancies with sub-Doppler saturated absorption measurements (Δ) [31] are also given along with uncertainty for this discrepancy, σ _{ Δ }, based on the uncertainties of both studies summed in quadrature. Also shown are the discrepancies with the GOSAT FTS database [8], ΔGOSAT, and with the HITRAN database [6], ΔHITRAN. (See Fig. 9.) All discrepancies are the present values minus referenced values. The last two rows report statistical analysis of the columns above. All units are in MHz.

Uncertainty Information: 0.2 MHz (acetylene), 0.3-54 MHz (methane, depending on line isolation).
