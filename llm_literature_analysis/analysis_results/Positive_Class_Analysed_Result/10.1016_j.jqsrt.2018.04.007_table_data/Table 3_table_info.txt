Uncertainty Information: 1.5 × 10^{−3} cm^{−1}

FOOTNOTES:
----------------------------------------
  1. Notes:
  2. [tb3fn1] “ + ”: ^{12}CH_{4} assigned line, “-: unassigned line, “3”: ^{13}CH_{4}
  3. [tb3fn3] I(296 K): line intensity at 296 K.
  4. [tb3fn4] Lower and upper state rovibrational assignments are given by the vibrational polyad number P, the rotational quantum number J, the rovibrational symmetry type C (T_{d} irreducible representation) and the rovibration ranking index α.
  5. [tb3fn5] E_{low} : recommended value for the lower state energy (in cm^{−1}). Order of priority: exact assignment, lower J, E_{emp} , default value (814.646210 cm^{−1}) corresponding to J = 12.
  6. [tb3fn6] Self-broadening coefficient obtained from [44].
  7. [tb3fn7] Air-broadening coefficient obtained from [45].
