Table Caption: The lineshape parameters of the six transitions of the 2v _{3} band of methane obtained from the multi-spectral fit. Symbol σ _{0} _{ }= ω _{0}/c is the position in wavenumber. All the uncertainties were given by the fitting algorithm of Levenberg-Marquardt [43,44]. The given intensity S was the average value of the intensities of the seven spectra and weighted by the natural isotopic abundance (0.988274 [36]) of ^{12}CH_{4}.
