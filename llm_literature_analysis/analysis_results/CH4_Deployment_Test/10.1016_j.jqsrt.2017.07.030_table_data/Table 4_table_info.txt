Table Caption: Sample of Electronic Supplementary data. Methane at 296 K with assignment in the 5300-5550 cm^{−1} region.

Uncertainty Information: 0.0025 cm-1 (RMS deviation of fit)

FOOTNOTES:
----------------------------------------
  1. Notes:
  2. [tb4fn1] + assigned line, - unassigned line, 3 corresponds to ^{13}CH_{4}.
  3. [tb4fn4] Lower and upper state rovibrational assignments are given by the vibrational polyad number P, the rotational quantum number J, the rovibrational symmetry type C (T_{d} irreducible representation) and the rovibration ranking index α.
  4. [tb4fn5] E_{low}: recommended value for the lower state energy [in cm^{−1}]. Order of priority: exact assignment, lower J, observed E lower, default E lower corresponded to J=12 (see Text).
  5. [tb4fn6] Self-Broadening coefficient obtained from [81].
  6. [tb4fn7] Air-Broadening coefficient obtained from [81].
