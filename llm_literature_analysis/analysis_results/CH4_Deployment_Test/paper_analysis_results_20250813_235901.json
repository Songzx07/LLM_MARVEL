It provides MARVEL-compatible experimental data, specifically new measured rovibrational transition wavenumbers for CH4 with full quantum number assignments for both upper and lower states. The uncertainty for these measurements can be inferred from the stated spectral resolution of 0.005 cm⁻¹. The complete dataset is available in the supplementary material, with a sample provided in Table 3, which explicitly details the presence of observed positions, intensities, and quantum assignments."

While it involves high-resolution FTIR spectroscopy and rovibrational analysis, the fundamental line positions and quantum number assignments for these transitions were explicitly adopted from the HITRAN2016 database. The paper's primary objective is to characterize the behavior (linewidths, shifts) of these known transitions under various pressure and temperature conditions, rather than to determine new, independently measured, and assigned transition wavenumbers for the purpose of reconstructing molecular energy levels. Therefore, its content and objective are not aligned with the core goal of the MARVEL algorithm, which requires new experimental transition wavenumber data for energy level reconstruction."
