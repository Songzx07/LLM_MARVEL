Table Caption: Transitions measured in this work, with their assignment and fitted characteristics.

Uncertainty Information: 180 to 480kHz

FOOTNOTES:
----------------------------------------
  1. ν is the line's frequency. $ Δ ν $ is the line's width (FWHM). $ S / N $ is the signal-to-noise-ratio. $ d ν $ is the frequency step. σ is one standard deviation from the Gaussian line fit. $ δ ν $ is the line position uncertainty using Landman's formula (2). Obs.-Calc. is the fit residual from the global CH_{4} fit (34,821 lines).
