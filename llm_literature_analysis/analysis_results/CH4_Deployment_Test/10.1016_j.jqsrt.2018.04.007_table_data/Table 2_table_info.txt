Table Caption: Wavenumbers and intensities of methane absorption lines recorded by DAS at 297 K and 80 K near 5732 cm^{−1}. The empirical values of the lower state energy levels, E_{emp} and corresponding J_{emp} values were obtained by the 2T-method for the transitions whose centre at 297 K and 80 K coincides within 0.003 cm^{−1}. This Table is a small section of the list attached as Supplementary Material. A similar list is also provided for T = 297 K.

Uncertainty Information: 1.5 × 10^{−3} cm^{−1}
