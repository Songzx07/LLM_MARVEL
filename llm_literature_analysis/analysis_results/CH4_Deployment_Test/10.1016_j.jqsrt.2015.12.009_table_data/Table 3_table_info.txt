Uncertainty Information: ±0.0001cm⁻¹

FOOTNOTES:
----------------------------------------
  1. Notes: The uncertainties listed in parentheses are 1-sigma statistical errors in the last quoted digit(s). As example, 5997.552718(16)cm^{−1} means 5997.552718±0.000016cm^{−1}. The lower vibrational state for all transitions is the ground state. The % unc listed under various columns correspond to one standard deviation statistical uncertainties obtained from the least squares fits. (F) values were fixed in the fit.
  2. [tbl3fna] J′C′α′ (upper-state rotational quanta); α is an index within the polyad scheme indicating the nth energy level having the rotational symmetry C [see Table 8 in Brown et al. Ref. [3].
  3. [tbl3fnb] J″C″α″ (lower-state rotational quanta).
  4. [tbl3fnc] S corresponds to measured line intensities and are in units of cm/molecule at 296K, [E−22=10 to the −22] and the % unc are listed in the column next to it.
  5. [tbl3fnd] $ b L 0 are $ the Lorentz-broadened half-width coefficients in cm^{−1} atm^{−1} at 296K; air-width coefficients are given at the top of each row and the self-width coefficients are listed at the bottom. The corresponding measured % uncertainties are listed in the column adjacent to their values.
  6. [tbl3fne] n represents the temperature dependence exponents (n _{1} and n _{2} in Eq. 1) of Lorentz-broadened half-width coefficients. They have no units. The value at the top of each row corresponds to air-broadened half-width and the bottom value to self-broadened half-width coefficient. The % uncertainties in n are listed under the next column.
  7. [tbl3fnf] $ δ 0 $ is the pressure-shift coefficient in cm^{−1} atm^{−1} at 296K. The air-shift coefficient is given at the top of each row while the self-shift coefficient is listed at the bottom. The corresponding measurement uncertainties (in units of the last digit quoted) are given in parentheses next to their values.
  8. [tbl3fng] $ δ ′ $ is the temperature dependence of the pressure-shift coefficient expressed in cm^{−1} atm^{−1} K^{−1}. The value at the top row corresponds to air-shift coefficient and that on the bottom row for the self-shift coefficient. The corresponding measurement uncertainties (in units of the last digit quoted) are listed in parentheses next to their values.
